### Solar System Probes project for DUWIT Hacks 2025 ###

Coding project created during 24hrs hackathon organised by Durham University Women in Tech society. 
The theme being "launch", our team created an interactive webpage of the Solar System and the most important probes launched to explore it, using Python, Java, HTML.

Upon opening the page, the planets set into motion at relative accurate speeds and upon clicking on Pluto, a new page opens with information on the probes that visited it. 
Planets, probes and background were entirely designed by us.

The project was uncompleted due to lack of time: whilst the designs for more probes were already made, the pages were not set up for planets other than Pluto.

As a bonus: by implementing the Google AIP for answering the user's questions, we were granted their first prize!
